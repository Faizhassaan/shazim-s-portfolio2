                  Hi, I'm Shazim Hassan, a creative and detail-oriented videographer and video editor with 5+ years of freelance experience in filming, editing, and producing content for clients across various industries. Adept at visual storytelling, using industry-standard tools, and managing projects from concept to delivery. Passionate about creating visually compelling content that engages audiences.

                <p>
                  I believe every story deserves to be told beautifully. Whether it's capturing the joy of a wedding day, the energy of a corporate event, or the essence of a brand, I bring passion and professionalism to every project.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I shoot with Sony mirrorless cameras, applying modern cinematic techniques to every project. My work was also recognized at SZABISTâ€™s Cinematic Saga competition, where our university film project won first place.
